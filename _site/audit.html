                names of input quantities is visually clunky, why does it start with 0x instead of 1x?

                generator seed can exceed 100, user’s manual says it cannot exceed that

                R expression text areas lack a grid structure layout when more than 1 is displayed

                field validations should be on the same screen, not on new tab after pressing compute

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Font and input sizes are too small!  A modular scale and better vertical rhythm would increase visual flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spacing and padding increases will help emphasize/isolate each step in the form fillout process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bold headers and lighter text will clue the user on how to use the form.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overall look and feel is boring and looks 'technical'.  A stronger font, and some small but impactful UI improvements for the field inputs would go a long way!

                there is no step by step with details for each field input

                visual hierarchy is very poor based from the first three points, modular scale would help
