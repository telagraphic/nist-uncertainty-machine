TL,DR
===

Redesigning NIST Uncertainty Machine to learn UI/UX principles to increase skills as a problem solver, designer/developer.  Maybe, just maybe they will use my work if they like it.  At the very least, I will add this project to my resume.  At the very worse, I don’t complete this project and either maybe learn some skills or I just give up with nothing but wasted time and effort.

Who and What?
===

NIST Uncertainty Machine is a tool to measure uncertainty for statistical modeling.
I saw the page on hacker news and thought it was cool and noticed the poor/bad look and feel.

Where and When?
===

It’s an open source tool located here developed in 2013 originally with a new update in 2018.

Why?
===

I’ve just started studying UI and UX and have been looking for projects to apply and test my new skills.
Sometimes you wanna create your own idea, but once I saw the website, I knew I could upgrade the look and flow of the tool.
I’ve always thought that a better, improved UI will attract more users or increase appeal.
It is a common sense notion that a better look thing will sell despite it’s usability factor.
It’s like the tinder swipe but for digital apps and websites.
In fact, there is an UX Principle that supports this notion.
It’s not a super big project that would be time consuming and the tool is simple enough to benefit from proven UI and UX concepts.


How?
===
I’ve already bookmarked tons of UI and UX resources (guides, tutorials, and articles).

So, the first step is to review these links and make notes of important principles and concepts used in the industry.

Second, create a checklist/guide that will provide a design framework.  There are many out there, but creating it my self is part of the learning process.  It doesn’t need to be a comprehensive how-to for everything, but a general template that can be added to over time.  

Third, performing a simple UI/UX audit will direct which parts need improvements.  Mapping concepts and principles to the actual UI/UX problems is the real challenge.  Iterating on different layouts, user flows, fonts, colors and how to code the UI components will be the real work.  The goal is to come up with at least 2 different layouts.  

Fourth, get feed back throughout the process at each step.  Better to do so at each step/day/week than all at the end.  And of course, I will reach out to the two NIST scientists that developed this tool and see if they like the update.

Post Points
===

- project copy and setup
- review html, css and js
- ui/ux audit
- header redesign
- footer ux changes
- form
 - commenting js lines < 10 to unify names and distribution onto same line and R definition output text areas
 - ux analysis of steps involved, simplifying into smaller steps, removing bullets
